# DeFi-Empire Assesment Readme
## Overview
Welcome to the "DeFi-Empire Assesment" project, a decentralized finance initiative that introduces the ERC20 token "buddy" (B) and a secure Vault contract. B follows the ERC20 standard, facilitating decentralized transactions with features such as total supply tracking, balance management, and events for transfers and approvals. The Vault contract, interacting through the IERC20 interface, provides a secure platform for users to deposit and withdraw funds, earning proportional shares. This foundation enables transparent and secure decentralized financial activities within the DeFi-Empire Assesment project, allowing users to conduct efficient transactions on the blockchain.
